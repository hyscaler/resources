# How to Set Up and Use Stable Diffusion XL Locally

## Introduction
Stable Diffusion XL is a cutting-edge AI model designed for generating high-resolution images from textual descriptions. This model, developed by Stability AI, leverages the power of deep learning to transform text prompts into vivid and detailed images, offering new horizons in the field of digital art and design. Refer to the [Stable Diffusion XL](https://stablediffusionweb.com/StableDiffusionXL) for more details.

## Requirements
To get started, ensure you have:
- Python version 3.10.6
- A suitable development environment

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Setup Python and Pip
Python is the backbone of this project, and Pip is the package manager used to install necessary libraries. First, ensure you have Python installed. Then, install or upgrade Pip using:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip
```
This command ensures you have the latest version of Pip installed.

### 2. Creating a Virtual Environment
A virtual environment in Python is a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation for a particular project. This approach avoids conflicts between project dependencies. Create and activate a virtual environment with:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Creating a Hugging Face Account
To access pre-trained models, including Stable Diffusion XL, sign up for a [Hugging Face account](https://huggingface.co/). This platform hosts various machine learning models and offers community and professional support.

### 4. Installing Required Packages
Install Diffusers and Gradio using Pip. [Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index) is a Hugging Face library offering pre-trained diffusion models for various tasks. [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) is an open-source library for creating user-friendly web interfaces for machine learning models.

```bash
pip install diffusers gradio torch transformers accelerate
```

### 5. Initial Code Setup
Write the following code in a file named `main.py`. This script sets up a basic Gradio interface to interact with the Stable Diffusion XL model. In this we are using Stable Diffusion XL Base model `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0` which is provided by Stability AI. Source code is available at https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models . And to using the model we are using [StableDiffusionXLPipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/stable_diffusion_xl#diffusers) from diffusers for text-to-image generation.

```python
import gradio as gr
from diffusers import StableDiffusionXLPipeline
import torch

# Load the model with specified parameters
base = StableDiffusionXLPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0", torch_dtype=torch.float16, variant="fp16", use_safetensors=True, 
)
base.to("cuda")

def query(payload):
    # Generate image based on the text prompt
    image = base(prompt=payload).images[0]
    return image

# Setup Gradio interface
demo = gr.Interface(fn=query, inputs="text", outputs="image")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    demo.launch(show_api=False)
```

To run this script, use:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This will provide you with a URL. When you open this URL, it will take you to the Gradio interface where you can input your prompts.

### 6. Generating Multiple Images
For generating multiple images, modify the script as follows.

```python
import gradio as gr
from diffusers import StableDiffusionXLPipeline
import torch

# Load the model
base = StableDiffusionXLPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0", torch_dtype=torch.float16, variant="fp16", use_safetensors=True, 
)
base.to("cuda")

def query(payload):
    # Generate multiple images based on the text prompt
    image = base(prompt=payload, num_images_per_prompt=2).images
    return image

# Setup Gradio interface for multiple images
demo = gr.Interface(fn=query, inputs="text", outputs="gallery")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    demo.launch(show_api=False)
```

### 7. Using Base and Refiner Models
For refined images, modify your script to include the base `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0` and refiner `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0` models. As we now using 2 models at a time so we need to use [DiffusionPipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/v0.24.0/en/api/pipelines/overview#diffusers.DiffusionPipeline). which support the bundling of multiple independently-trained models, schedulers, and processors into a single end-to-end class.

```python
import gradio as gr
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

# Load base and refiner models with specified parameters
base = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0", torch_dtype=torch.float16, variant="fp16", use_safetensors=True
)
base.to("cuda")
refiner = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0",
    text_encoder_2=base.text_encoder_2,
    vae=base.vae,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    use_safetensors=True,
    variant="fp16",
)
refiner.to("cuda")

# Define processing steps
n_steps = 40
high_noise_frac = 0.8

def query(payload):
    # Generate and refine image based on the text prompt
    image = base(prompt=payload, num_inference_steps=n_steps, denoising_end=high_noise_frac, output_type="latent").images
    image = refiner(prompt=payload, num_inference_steps=n_steps, denoising_start=high_noise_frac, image=image).images[0]
    return image

# Setup Gradio interface for refined images
demo = gr.Interface(fn=query, inputs="text", outputs="image")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    demo.launch(show_api=False)
```
